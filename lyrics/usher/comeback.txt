Come Back


What y'all wanna do?
What y'all wanna do?
Tell me

See, around here, we're just too much
We could slow down and you still couldn't catch us
My town full of heavy-hitters, bread-getters
Real fly, unforgettable-type niggas
See, all I do is keep hitting them up
Getting them up, shaking your butt, nigga, what
Lil Liberaci, can't nobody stop me
Always making moves, so you better watch me
Slide to the south side in my blue drop top, 355
Keeping it live
When you wanna make them jump, you know what to do
Call me and my crew to the rescue
Captain So So Def
We rocks the party 'til there's no one left
Turn your volume up a notch
And watch the ba-bomb, bump-bump-bump make your speakers pop


You never missed your water 'til your well runs dry
I never missed my woman 'til she said goodbye
Now my heart's made a change
My whole world's rearrange
And I'm ready to give you what you deserved
Baby, baby, baby, please

Come back, come back
Lover, this is where you belong
In my arms, in my world
Come back, come back
Lover, this is where you belong
In my life, as my girl

The grass is greener on the other side
We take people for granted 'til they're out of sight
I don't think that you know how much I'm going through
I don't think that you know how much I really love you

All I do, is think of you
I can't eat, can't sleep, baby it ain't hard to see (all I do)
All I do, is think of you
And you bump, diggy bump, bump, bump
Diggy, diggy, bump, bump, baby

Come back, come back
Lover, this is where you belong
In my arms, in my world
Come back, come back
Lover, this is where you belong
In my life, as my girl
Come back, come back (it's not what you want, baby)
Lover, this is where you belong (but what you need, sugar, come back with me)
In my arms, in my world (satisfaction guaranteed, baby)
Come back, come back (it's not what you want, baby)
Lover, this is where you belong (but what you need, sugar, come back with me)
In my life, as my girl (satisfaction guaranteed, baby)
Come back, come back (it's not what you want, baby)
Lover, this is where you belong (but what you need, sugar, come back with me)
In my arms, in my world (satisfaction guaranteed, baby)
Come back, come back (it's not what you want, baby)
Lover, this is where you belong (but what you need, sugar, come back with me)
In my life, as my girl (satisfaction guaranteed, baby)
