You Make Me Wanna


This is what you do, this is what you do
This is what you do, this is what you do


You make me wanna leave the one I'm with (Ooh, yeah)
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do (Ooh, baby)
I think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me (Make me, you're making me)
Wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do (Ah, yeah, yeah-yeah)
I think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me

Before anything began between us, you were like my best friend
The one I used to run and talk to when me and my girl was having problems
You used to say it'll be okay
Suggest little nice things I should do
And when I'd go home at night and lay my head down
All I seemed to think about was you
And how

You make me wanna leave the one I'm with (Ooh yeah)
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do (Ah, babe)
I think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me
Wanna leave the one I'm with (Oh, babe)
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do (Come on, come on, come on, come on)
I think about a ring and all the things that come along with (Oh yeah)
You make me, you make me

Now, what's bad is you're the one that hooked us up
Knowing it should've been you
And what's sad is that I love her, but I'm falling for you
What should I do?
Should I, tell my baby bye-bye?
Should I, do exactly what I feel inside?
'Cause I, I don't wanna go, don't need to stay
But I really need to get it together

You make me wanna leave the one I'm with (Oh, ooh, baby)
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do (Say what you do)
I think about a ring and all the things that come along with (Ah, yeah)
You make me, you make me
Wanna leave the one I'm with (Ooh, baby)
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
I think about a ring and all the things that come along with (Yeah-hey)
You make me, you make me

At this point, the situation's out of control
I never meant to hurt her, but I gotta let her go (Gotta let her go)
And if she may not understand it while all of this is going on
I tried, I tried to fight it, but the feeling's just too strong
You make, make, make me (You make me wanna)


(Hey) You make me wanna
You make me wanna (Oh)
(Oh, you make, make, make me)
You make me wanna
You make me wanna (Ooh, oh, babe)
You make me wanna (Go on, babe, do your thing)
You make me wanna (Ooh, ooh-ooh yeah)
(Come along with it â you're making me, you're making me)


You make me wanna leave the one I'm with (Oh, ooh, baby)
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do (Say what you do)
I think about a ring and all the things that come along with (Ah, yeah)
You make me, you make me
Wanna leave the one I'm with (Ooh, baby)
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
I think about a ring and all the things that come along with (Yeah-hey)
You make me, you make me (You're making me)
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do (Ooh, you're making me, you're making me, you're making me)
I think about a ring and all the things that come along with (Oh)
You make me, you make me (You make me)
Wanna leave the one I'm with (Wanna leave the one I'm with)
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do (You make me, you make me do)
I think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me
