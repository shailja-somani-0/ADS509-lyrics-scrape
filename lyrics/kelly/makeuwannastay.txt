Make U Wanna Stay

It's been a minute
We been talking on the phone
Hit me on my two way turning me on
And I'm about to lose my mind
Say you wanna meet me
Baby it's been way too long
Time to quit playing
Let's get it on
I'm 'a show you I'm for real, for real

I'm gonna make you want me
I'm gonna make you come see me, never gonna want no-one but me
I'm gonna make you come see me, never gonna want no-one but me
I'm gonna make you mine

Make you wanna stay baby, I'm gonna
Make you wanna stay baby, I'm gonna
Make you wanna stay baby
Make you, make you

Baby we been waiting, but I ain't gonna wait no more
Boy because what you feel you can't ignore
(Baby you can't ignore)
Don't even deny it
We wasted too much time
I'm about to make you see
I'm about to make you mine
