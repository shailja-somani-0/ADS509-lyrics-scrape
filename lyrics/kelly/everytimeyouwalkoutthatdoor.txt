Everytime You Walk Out That Door

The table set for dinner only just for one
Staring at your empty chair
Remembering all of the crazy laughs we shared
Last time you were sitting there

I can hear your voice still calling out my name
And smell your scent upon the pillow next to me
Imagining your kisses when I close my eyes
They don't replace you holding me

A house is not a home when I'm alone here
Summer turns to winter when you're gone
And all I see are clouds outside my window
Every time you walk out that door

And in the morning as I slowly wash my face
Feel you sneaking upon me
Go to my reflection staring tells me everything
I'm alone you're not really there

I can hear your voice still calling out my name
And smell your scent upon the pillow next to me
Imagining your kisses when I close my eyes
They don't replace you holding me

A house is not a home when I'm alone here
Summer turns to winter when you're gone
And all I see are clouds outside my window
Every time you walk out that door

I'm not saying that I can't just live without you
But my life's so much better when you're here
You turn my darkness to light
And you make everything all right
By my side

A house is not a home when I'm alone here
Summer turns to winter when you're gone
And all I see are clouds outside my window
Every time you walk out that door

A house is not a home when I'm alone here
Summer turns to winter when you're gone
And all I see are clouds outside my window
Every time you walk out that door

Every time you walk out
Every time you walk out
Every time you walk out
