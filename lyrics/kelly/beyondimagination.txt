Beyond Imagination

You speak only what you hear
Easily influential
So secluded when no one's near
This home's full of rituals
Your mother's going on strike
Tired of preaching sermons and
Father's vacation tonight
Is somewhat permanent

I gotta go
To somewhere beyond imaginations flow
Hear my tone
It says I am alone

Your life seems dysfunctional
It only acts what you show
You're your own psychiatrist
A slight minute from quitting
Showing signs of depression
Life's falling over and crashing
Your heat burns through like lava
And rapes your problem solver, now go

I gotta go
To somewhere beyond imaginations flow
Hear my tone
It says I am alone

A hideout
Manifest stability
Let go of doubt
Get away
No flaws will inject or exit my
Present place
I gotta burn
Experience only allows what I will learn
Hear my tone
It says I am alone, yeah
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na

I hear your tone
And you're so not alone
You're so not alone
