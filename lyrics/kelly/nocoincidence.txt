No Coincidence

Two distant hearts on a map, both going nowhere fast
Late for an appointment they end up together in a city cab
They share a fare and some friendly conversation
That's no coincidence, that's love
She scrambles through her purse
He rushed in through the front
Looking for change
There a few bucks in the back of the restaurant
They start to dance
'Til this day their still dancing
That's no coincidence, that's love

It's amazing
It's perfection
How each little bit of a star makes up one big constellation
Of people getting connected
It's truly heaven sent
It's evident that love is no coincidence

He snapped a photograph, she took a sonogram
She didn't tell him, he shipped off to war in a foreign land
Left home a solider, but came back a father
That's no coincidence that's love

Somebody crashed her car
He's got a failing heart
One thing can save them
An operation neither can afford
With true hesitation, two families get acquainted
That's no coincidence that L-O-V-E

It's amazing
It's perfection
How each little bit of a star makes up one big constellation
Of people getting connected
It's truly heaven sent
It's evident that love is no coincidence
It's perfection
How each little bit of a star makes up one big constellation
Of people getting connected
It's truly heaven sent
It's evident that love is no coincidence

How we intertwine is divine (extraordinary)
Open your eyes and you'll find (it's involuntary )
Seasons have reasons for changing
(So that everybody)
Can find love find love again
And again and again and again

It's amazing
It's perfection
How each little bit of a star makes up one big constellation
Of people getting connected
It's truly heaven sent
It's evident that love is no coincidence
It's amazing
It's perfection
How each little bit of a star makes up one big constellation
Of people getting connected
It's truly heaven sent
It's evident that love is no coincidence
