Haven't Told You

Look in my eyes
What do you see
Only me
Got nothing to hide
Seek and you'll find
What's on my mind

This happened so fast not a part of my plan
So I'm leaving my heart in your hands

Haven't told you just how much I love you
Only by dreaming I show my feelings
Haven't told you just how much I love you
Time for revealing
And I will give you something too
A love from me to you
Oh yeah oh

Look in my eyes
You know me so well
Can't you tell that I'm
Way in too deep
I'm going down
So catch me now

It happens so fast not a part of my plan
Now I'm leaving my heart in your hands

Haven't told you just how much I love you
Only by dreaming I show my feelings
Haven't told you just how much I love you
Time for revealing
And I will give you something too
A love from me to you
Oh yeah oh

I feel you every day
I breathe you every single moment from the start
I see you constantly
I feel you oh
You move me so
No letting go
You smile at me
My heart is yours to keep

Haven't told you just how much I love you
Only by dreaming I show my feelings
Haven't told you just how much I love you
Time for revealing
And I will give you something too

Have I told you just how much I love you
Only by dreaming I show my feelings
Haven't told you just how much I love you
Time for revealing
And I will give you something too

A love from me to you
Oh yeah oh
