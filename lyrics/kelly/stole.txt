Stole

He was always such a nice boy
The quiet one, with good intentions
He was down for his brother, respectful to his mother
A good boy
But good don't get attention
One kid with a promise
The brightest kid in school, he's not a fool
Readin' books about science and smart stuff
It's not enough, no
'Cause smart don't make you cool, whoa

He's not invisible anymore
With his Father's nine and a broken fuse
Since he walked through that classroom door
He's all over prime-time news

Mary's got the same size hands
As Marilyn Monroe
She put her fingers in the imprints
At Mann's Chinese Theater Show
She could've been a movie star
Never got the chance to go that far
Her life was stole, oh
Now we'll never know
(No, no, no, no, oh)

They were cryin' to the camera, said he never fitted in
He wasn't welcome
He showed up to the parties we was hangin' in
Some guys were puttin' him down
Bullyin' him 'round, round
Now I wish I would've talked to him
Gave him the time of day and not turned away
If I would've been the one to maybe go this far
He might have stayed at home
Playin' angry chords on his guitar

He's not invisible anymore
With his baggy pants and his legs in chains
Since he walked through that classroom door
Everybody knows his name

Mary's got the same size hands (Oh)
As Marilyn Monroe
She put her fingers in the imprints (Ooh)
At Mann's Chinese Theater Show (She could've been a movie star)
She could've been a movie star (Oh-oh)
Never got the chance to go that far (Oh)
Her life was stole, oh
Now we'll never know (Now we'll never know, oh)

Greg was always getting net from 20 feet away (20 feet away)
He had a tryout with the Sixers, couldn't wait for Saturday (Saturday)
Now we're never gonna see him slam
Flyin' high as Kobe can
His life was stole, oh
Now we'll never know (Now we'll never never never know)

Mm, now we'll never never never never know
Stole, stole, stole
Stole, stole, stole
Ooh-oh, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah

Mary's got the same size hands
As Marilyn Monroe (Oh-oh)
She put her fingers in the imprints
At Mann's Chinese Theater Show (She was gonna be a star, oh no)
She could've been a movie star
Never got the chance to go that far (Never got the chance, yeah)
Her life was stole, oh (Stole, stole)
Oh, now we'll never know (Now we'll never never know, no)

Greg was always getting net from 20 feet away (He had game, oh)
He had a tryout with the Sixers, couldn't wait for Saturday
Now we're never gonna see him slam (Never see him)
Flyin' high as Kobe can
His life was stole, oh
Now we'll never know (Now we'll never never know, no)

Oh, no no no
Yeah, their lives were stole
Now we'll never know
We were here all together, yesterday
