Can't Nobody

I'm tryin' to let you know what it's all about
I know you wanna leave
So many little games silly people play
Don't act foolishly
I'm so real, so soft to the touch
My love, my kiss, so sweet, glorious
The look on your face, anyone can see
No one does it like me

Oh no, oh no, can't nobody do it like me
Uh uh, oh no, can't nobody do it like me
Oh no, oh no, can't nobody do it like me (Baby)
Uh uh, and get right down to it like me
Oh no, oh no, can't nobody do it like me (Oh)
Uh uh, oh no, can't nobody love you like me
Oh no, oh no, can't nobody do it like me (Oh, no)
Uh uh, no-no-no-no-no-no, no-no (Hey)

I knew you'd be the one to come out your mouth
I need you please to relax
I know I messed up but if you leave me now
Ain't no comin' back, no more
No me, no you, no us, no kiss, no hugs, tell the truth
Huh, see, I'm the only one that can love you, babe
You're not that big a fool

Oh no, oh no, can't nobody do it like me (Oh, no)
Uh uh, oh no, can't nobody do it like me (Nobody)
Oh no, oh no, can't nobody do it like me

Oh no, oh no, can't nobody do it like me (Baby, they can't)
Uh uh, no-no-no-no-no-no, no-no (Nobody)

Can't no one else but me do (The things)
The things that I do to you (The things that I do to you)
The things that I do to you (Baby)
Can't no one else but me do (They can't do the things that I do to you)
The things that I do to you (The things that I do to you)
The things that I do to you (No, no no)
