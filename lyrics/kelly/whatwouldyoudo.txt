What Would You Do

Oh, oh
La, la, la, la, la, la, la

I wanna get down with you
Been watching the way you're moving
It's like a love scene, too real to believe
You have this effect on me
And my girls have never seen
Me act this way over
Any man but my own

You're doing everything right
I turned down so many guys tonight
They're just acting ready, then forget it
I need more than meets the eye, so

It's on tonight, even though (on tonight)
I got a man and you know (got a man)
'Cause it's all around (all around)
But it's goin' down
'Cause I like the way you move ('cause I like the way)
Can't help wanting you
So if I put it on you
Tell me, what would you do

I'm making my way to you now
And I'm gonna be working it out
Boy, you can't lose
If you decide you wanna put it on me too
I'm breaking the rules again, now (I can't lie)
I ain't gonna play if I don't know why
You're tempting me, I really wanna be dancing with you, you, ooh

You're doing everything right
I turned down so many guys tonight
They're just acting ready, then forget it
I need more than meets the eye, so

It's on tonight, even though (on tonight)
I got a man and you know (I got a man)
'Cause it's all around (all around)
But it's goin' down (goin' down)
'Cause I like the way you move (I like the way)
Can't help wanting you (can't help you, baby)
So if I put it on you
Tell me, what would you do

I didn't wanna do wrong
Just wanna have a good time
'Cause you got it, and I want it
Boy you're blowin' my mind
What would you do, if I stepped up to you
'Cause you got it, and I want it
If you're feelin' me too, then it's on

It's on tonight, even though (it is on)
I got a man and you know (I got a man)
'Cause it's all around (all around)
But it's goin' down (goin' down)
'Cause I like the way you move
Can't help wanting you (wanting you)
So if I put it on you (on you)
Tell me, what would you do
Yeah
Tell me what would you do
It's on tonight, even though (what would you do)
I got a man and you know ('cause I wanna dance)
'Cause it's all around (baby with you)
But it's goin' down (you, you, you)
'Cause I like the way you move (I wanna dance)
Can't help wanting you (baby with you)
So if I put it on you
Tell me, what would you do

It's on tonight, even though (on tonight)
I got a man and you know (you know)
'Cause it's all around (all around)
But it's goin' down (it's goin' down)
'Cause I like the way you move (it's goin' down)
Can't help wanting you
So if I put it on you
Tell me, what would you do
