Heaven

I wanna love together
Kissing and touching feels better
Now that I have, have you
I couldn't ask for nothing more
Like a misty breeze on a summer day
Or the warmth of sun after rain, you
Always seem to balance me with your love
If you're far away I want you near
It might sound clichÃ©d but my words are so sincere
Can't you taste the joy inside my tears (I'm so in love)

I've found love's treasure in this ocean of pleasure
And now that I have, have you
I won't search for anything more
Oh love
What have you done to me
This crazy feeling I can't describe
It feels like love it must be love it must be love
Feels like snow caressing mountain tops
When I see your eyes from afar
All I can do is run with open arms
Love is all I got
I feel so at home
When we're alone, oh

Love, when I'm in your arms
Feels like I'm melting into you
You keep me so warm
Ooh, I feel so high above
Caught a glimpse of heaven in your eyes
Thanks for showing me love (Your love so good)

Baby we will grow together
This is a joint endeavor
And there's nothing I'd rather see
Than the love in your eyes for me
'Cause this feeling is so surreal
You touch me places I didn't feel
I used won't but now I will trust in love
I'm elated and overjoyed
Over this connection between a girl and boy
I was empty till you filled the void
I'm so in love

Love, when I'm in your arms
Feels like I'm melting into you
You keep me so warm
Ooh, I feel so high above
Caught a glimpse of heaven in your eyes
Thanks for showing me love (Your love so good)
