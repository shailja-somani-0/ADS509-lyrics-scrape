Love/Hate

See, I love to love you, boy
And I love to hate you
See, I love to love you, boy
And I love to hate you
I'm a have to let you go
(Kelly, let 'em know)

I am so in love
I am so in hate
I just can't comprehend it, ah
You gettin' me so high
You gettin' me so low
I can't show what I'm feeling, ooh
Never was the type
To let someone like you
Get up under my skin, no
Tried like hell, but
You didn't care for real
You stepped on my feelings, ooh

See, I love to love you, boy
And I love to hate you
But I got to let you know
I'ma have to let you go
See, I love to love you, boy
And I love to hate you
But I got to let you know
I'ma have to let you go

Love to feel the love
Love to heal from pain
Is there really a difference?
Wonder who is right
Wonder who is wrong
I'm just feeling some tension, ah
You can't compromise
We can't coincide
We should really be chilling
Cause I've wasted so much time
Love is on the line
I've made my decision, yeah

It's useless to try and work things out
Don't need all of this stress
You're not worth it
I'm tired of all the ups and downs
So goodbye, I'm leaving
Made up my mind

See, I love to love you, boy
And I love to hate you
But I got to let you know
I'ma have to let you go
See, I love to love you, boy
And I love to hate you
But I got to let you know
I'ma have to let you go

It's useless to try and work things out
Don't need all of this stress

And I love to hate you
But I got to let you know
I'ma have to let you go
See, I love to love you, boy
And I love to hate you
But I got to let you know
I'ma have to let you go

See, I love to love you, boy
And I love to hate you

I'ma have to let you go
