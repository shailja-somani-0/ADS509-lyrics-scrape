Simply Deep

Is anybody home in there?
I unexpectedly dropped by your heart
I simply wanted you to hear
The cry of my love's never ending start
Impossible escaping you
And circumstances never stand a chance
So intrigued by the things you do

Through my eyes I vision you
Your love protects my every move
And my life sways to your heart beat
My everlasting love is simply deep

Each second spent is timeless
When I'm with you, time seems to take a rest
No routines ever lay with us
'Cause everything is new, when you're in love
So delighted that you feel the same
You say with me you're never liable to pain
Never love another again

Through my eyes I envision you
Your love protects my every move
And my life sways to your heart beat
My everlasting love is simply deep

As I lay you in the midst of ongoing creation
Me as a whole, can only think of you
And you breathe the air that surrounds the every move I run
And I never sleep, without endless dreams
Of love so simple deep
Between you and me!

Through my eyes I vision you
Your love protects my every move
And my life sways to your heart beat
My everlasting love is simply deep

Through my eyes I vision you
Your love protects my every move
And my life sways to your heart beat
My everlasting love is simply deep

Through my eyes I vision you
Your love protects my every move
And my life sways to your heart beat
My everlasting love is simply deep
So simply deep, oh-oh
