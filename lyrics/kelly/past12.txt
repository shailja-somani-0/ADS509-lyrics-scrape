Past 12

I met this guy
He was always on the floor
But he's dancing by himself
I don't know why
Because he's looking hot to death
So I
Began to think
If I go out on the floor
There's a chance he'll notice me
And when he did
It was popping sweet

We can get out on the floor
But take it slow
Baby, won't you keep it right there
Yeah, we can take it there
Boy I don't really care
It's all good with me
We can bounce up in the club
Or kick it in ya truck
Long as it's sitting on doves, it's love
Because we ain't gotta go no where
Let's get it crunch tonight

It's past 12 o'clock
And I'm trying to put it on lock
Makin' sure the parties don't stop
Bottles stay popped
Think I'm feeling what you got (all night)
It's past 12 o'clock
And I'm trying to keep it on lock
Won't you come and dance with me
Then we'll see, if you're gonna be with me

I must admit
That I'm not so bold when it
Comes to other guys
I ain't going trip
First for everything
And I hope that this
Is a thing I won't regret
When morning comes
When the party ends
Is it gonna be you and me?

We can get out on the floor
But take it slow
Baby, won't you keep it right there
Yeah, we can take it there
Boy I don't really care
It's all good with me
We can bounce up in the club
Or kick it in your truck
Long as it's sitting on doves, it's love
Because we ain't got to go nowhere
Let's get it crunch tonight

It's past 12 o'clock
And I'm trying to put it on lock
Makin' sure the parties don't stop
Bottles stay popped
Think I'm feeling what you got (all night)
It's past 12 o'clock
And I'm trying to keep it on lock
Won't you come and dance with me
Then we'll see, if you're gonna be with me

Boy if the feeling's right
We can rock all night for sure
Don't you know that
Boy, when the clock strikes 2
I'm gonna be with you for sure

It's past 12 o'clock
And I'm trying to put it on lock
Makin' sure the parties don't stop
Bottles stay popped
Think I'm feeling what you got (all night)
It's past 12 o'clock
And I'm trying to keep it on lock
Won't you come and dance with me
Then we'll see, if you're gonna be with me

It's past 12 o'clock
And I'm trying to put it on lock
Making sure
It's past 12 o'clock
And I'm trying to put it on lock
Show me what you got
It's past 12 o'clock
And I'm trying to put it on lock
Show me what you got
